# Component Name
CreativeMimic

# Description
The CreativeMimic component is a Yeager Workflow component designed to generate an article based on the provided writing samples and desired topic. It uses the `transform()` method to process input data and return the generated article as output.

# Input and Output Models
The component utilizes Pydantic BaseModel for input and output data types.

## Input Model
- **CreativeMimicIn**:
    - WritingSamplesUpload (List[str]): A list of writing samples to be used for mimicking.
    - DesiredTopic (str): The topic of the generated article.
    - style_features_extraction_method (Optional[str], default: "default"): The method used for extracting style features.
    - content_generation_algorithm (Optional[str], default: "transformers"): The algorithm used for generating the article content.

## Output Model
- **CreativeMimicOut**:
    - GeneratedArticle (str): The generated article.

# Parameters
- **args** (CreativeMimicIn): The input arguments for the component.
- **callbacks** (typing.Any): Callback methods provided by the workflow.
- **results_dict**: A dictionary containing the generated article.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` method is asynchronous and implements the following steps:
1. Call the `super().transform(args, callbacks)` method to execute parent class's transform method.
2. Extract the generated article from the `results_dict`.
3. Create a `CreativeMimicOut` instance with the `GeneratedArticle` parameter.
4. Return the `CreativeMimicOut` instance as output.

# External Dependencies
- fastapi: Provides the FastAPI framework for the "/transform/" endpoint.
- pydantic: Used for input and output data validation and serialization.
- typing: Annotates types for the component's parameters and methods.

# API Calls
This component does not make any external API calls.

# Error Handling
Error handling and validation are provided by the Pydantic BaseModel for input and output data types.

# Examples
To use the CreativeMimic component within a Yeager Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Create a `CreativeMimic` instance:
